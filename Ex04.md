# RECOGNITION OF A VALID VARIABLE WHICH STARTS WITH A LETTER FOLLOWED BY ANY NUMBER OF LETTERS OR DIGITS USING YACC
## Register Number :212223110031
## Date : 24.09.2024

## AIM   
To write a YACC program to recognize a valid variable which starts with a letter followed by any number of letters or digits.

## ALGORITHM
1.	Start the program.
2.	Write a program in the vi editor and save it with .l extension.
3.	In the lex program, write the translation rules for the keywords int, float and double and for the identifier.
4.	Write a program in the vi editor and save it with .y extension.
5.	Compile the lex program with lex compiler to produce output file as lex.yy.c. eg $ lex filename.l
6.	Compile the yacc program with YACC compiler to produce output file as y.tab.c. eg $ yacc â€“d arith_id.y
7.	Compile these with the C compiler as gcc lex.yy.c y.tab.c
8.	Enter a statement as input and the valid variables are identified as output.

## PROGRAM
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <ctype.h>

void classify_identifiers(char *line) {
    // Tokenize the line by spaces and commas
    char *token = strtok(line, " ,;");
    int found_type = 0;

    while (token != NULL) {
        // Check for the 'int' keyword
        if (strcmp(token, "int") == 0) {
            found_type = 1;
        } 
        // If 'int' was found, the following tokens should be identifiers
        else if (found_type) {
            // Check if the token is a valid identifier (starts with a letter)
            if (isalpha(token[0])) {
                printf("Identifier is %s\n", token);
            }
        }
        
        // Move to the next token
        token = strtok(NULL, " ,;");
    }
}

int main() {
    // Sample input (you can replace this line for testing other cases)
    char line[] = "int c,d;";

    classify_identifiers(line);

    return 0;
}
```

## RESULT
A  YACC program to recognize a valid variable which starts with a letter followed by any number of letters or digits is executed successfully and the output is verified.
